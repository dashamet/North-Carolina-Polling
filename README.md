# Polling Data from the 3rd Wave of North Carolina's 9th Congressional District

This repo contains my analysis of polling data from the 3rd wave of North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. In part 1, I answer basic questions about the data. In part 2, I create a table breaking down respondents' party support by their race. In part 3, I create a violin plot relating the weight given to respondents in the polling data and their education level. In part 4, I create a series of graphs breaking down respondents' party support by age and gender. 

The data I used is from polling conducted by The New York Times and Siena College: https://github.com/TheUpshot/2018-live-poll-results/tree/master/data
