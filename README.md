# North Carolina Congressional Polling Data

* `nc_polling.Rmd` contains my analysis of polling data from the 3rd wave of North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. It produces the HTML file `nc_polling.Rmd`. 
  * In part 1, I conduct a preliminary exploratory analysis of the data. 
  * In part 2, I create a table breaking down party support by race.
  * In part 3, I create a violin plot relating the weight given to poll respondents and education level.
  * In part 4, I create a series of graphs breaking down party support by age and gender.  

* `ps_4_elections-poll-nc09-3.csv` is the dataset I used. This data is from [polling](https://github.com/TheUpshot/2018-live-poll-results/tree/master/data) conducted by The New York Times and Siena College.
